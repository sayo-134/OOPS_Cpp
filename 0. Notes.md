## Object Oriented Programming
<br>

## Class and Object
- **Class**:- User-defined data-type
```  
    class Student{  
    string name[50];  
    int roll;  
    };  
 ```
- **Object**:- Instance of class
- Empty Class:- Size: 1 byte
- Accessing properties/data members:- using "." operator
- ### Access modifiers:-
  - **Public**: data members are accessible inside and outside class.
  - **Private**: data members are accessible only inside the class. Default access modifier.
  - **Protected**: data members are accessible inside the class and also inside the child class.
- Private members are not accessible outside the class, to do so, we need to use getter/setter
```
  int setRoll(int Roll){
      roll = Roll;
  }
  
  int getRoll(){
      return roll;
  }
```
### Allocation of memory 
- **Static Allocation**:
```
    Student std;
    // data members should be accessed using "." operator
    std.setRoll(5);
    cout << "Student roll" << std.getRoll();
```
- **Dynamic Allocation**
```
    Student *std = new Student;
    // data members should be accessed using "->" operator
    std->setRoll(5);
    cout << "Student roll" << std->roll;
```
### Constructor
#### Default Constructor
- Invoked during object creation
- No return type
- No i/p parameter
#### Parameterised Constructor
```
    Student(string name, int roll){
        this->name = name;
        this->roll = roll;
    }
```
- Default constructor vanishes after we use parameterised constructor

#### _this_ keyword
- it stores the address of the current object

#### Copy Constructor
#### Shallow copy and Deep copy
- In shallow copy(by using default constructor), same memory location is accessed by two different names, hence, when the original object is changed, the copied object is also changed.
- In deep copy(by writing copy function in class). the data members are copied to the new object, the locations are not same.
```
    // deep copy constructor
    Student(Student& temp){
        this->name = temp.name;
        this->roll = temp.roll;
    }
    
    Student S1(S, 22);
    
    // default(shallow) copy constructor
    Student S2(S1);
    // or, Student S2 = S1 // using assignment operator
    // properties of S1 are copied into S2
```
#### Destructor
- used for memory-deallocation
- name: same as class
- no return type
- no i/p parameter
```
    ~Student(){
        cout << "Destructor is called" << endl;
    }
```
- for static type memory allocation, destructor is called automatically
- for dynamic memory allocation, destructor should be called manually by using _delete_ keyword
#### Static datatype
- belongs to class, not object
- doesn't need an object to initiate
- _this_ keyword cannot be used
```
    data_type class_name :: field name = value // " :: " -> scope resolution operator
```

### 4 Pillars of OOPS - Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism & Abstraction
#### Encapsulation
- wrapping up data member & function
- **Fully Encapsulated Class**: All data members are private  
- Advantage: a) Information hiding to increase security  
             b) if we want, we can make the class _read only_  
             c) code reusability
             d) unit testing
- Implementation:
```
    class Student{
        private:
            int roll;
            int section;
        public:
            int getRoll(){
                return this->roll;
            }
    };
```
#### Inheritance
- Implementation:
```
    class parent_class{
        // body of the parent class
    };
    class child_class: access_modifier parent_class{
        // body of the child class
    };
```
#### Access Modifiers and Inheritance:
| Super-class Access Modifer | Mode of Inheritance | Resulting Access Modifier in Sub-class |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Public | Public | Public |
| Public | Protected | Protected |
| Public | Private | Private |
| Protected | Public | Protected |
| Protected | Protected | Protected |
| Protected | Private | Private |
| Private | Any | Not Accessible |
- Private data memebers of any class cannot be inherited
#### Types of Inheritance
- **Single**
- **Multi-level**
- **Multiple**
- **Hybrid**
- **Hierarchical**
- **Single Inheritance**
