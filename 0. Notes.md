## Object Oriented Programming
- It is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" - which can contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields or _attributes_ whereas the code is in the form of procedures or _methods_.
<br>

## Class and Object
- **Class**:- User-defined data-type
```  
    class Student{
    // properties:
    char name[50];  
    int roll;  
    };

    // creation of object
    int main(){
    Student Suvam; // declaration of object
    }  
 ```
- **Object**:- Instance of class
- Size of Any object of a class: Total size of the properties
- Empty Class:- Size: 1 byte (not zero). This is for identification of the object.
- Accessing properties/data members:- using "." operator
- ### Access modifiers:-
  - **Public**: data members are accessible inside and outside class.
  - **Private**: data members are accessible only inside the class. Default access modifier.
  - **Protected**: data members are accessible inside the class and also inside the child class.
- Default Access modifier: Private
- Private members are not accessible outside the class, to do so, we need to use getter/setter
```
  int setRoll(int Roll){
      roll = Roll;
  }
  
  int getRoll(){
      return roll;
  }
```
### Allocation of memory 
- **Static Allocation**:
```
    Student std;
    // data members should be accessed using "." operator
    std.setRoll(5);
    cout << "Student roll" << std.getRoll();
```
- **Dynamic Allocation**
```
    Student *std = new Student;
    // data members should be accessed using "->" operator
    std->setRoll(5);
    cout << "Student roll" << std->roll;
```
### Constructor
#### Default Constructor
- Invoked during object creation
- No return type
- No i/p parameter
- If we do not write any constructor, it is implicit.
- If we write any constructor, the compiler's constructor will vanish.
```
    Student(){
        cout << "This is default constructor"" << endl;
    }
```
#### Parameterised Constructor
```
    Student(string name, int roll){
        this->name = name;
        this->roll = roll;
    }
```
- Default constructor vanishes after we use parameterised constructor

#### _this_ keyword
- it stores the address of the current object. This is nothing but a pointer to the object.

#### Copy Constructor
- We use "pass by reference" instead of "pass by value", otherwise the copy constructor call will stuck at an infinite loop.
#### Shallow copy and Deep copy
- In shallow copy(by using default constructor), same memory location is accessed by two different names, hence, when the original object is changed, the copied object is also changed. We do not need to write any extra code for the default copy constructor.
- In deep copy(by writing copy function in class). the data members are copied to the new object, the locations are not same. Here we need to write an extra copy constructor code as shown below.
- In main(), the codes for both copy constructors are same.
```
    // deep copy constructor
    Student(Student& temp){
        this->name = temp.name;
        this->roll = temp.roll;
    }
    
    Student S1(S, 22);
    
    // default(shallow) copy constructor
    Student S2(S1);
    // or, Student S2 = S1 // using assignment operator
    // properties of S1 are copied into S2
```
#### Destructor
- used for memory-deallocation
- name: same as class
- no return type
- no i/p parameter
```
    ~Student(){
        cout << "Destructor is called" << endl;
    }
```
- for static type memory allocation, destructor is called automatically
- for dynamic memory allocation, destructor should be called manually by using _delete_ keyword
  ```
      int main(){
        Student a; // for static memory allocation, destructor is automatically called
        Student *b = new Student(); // for dynamic memory allocation
        delete b; // destructor is called manually
      }
  ```
#### Static datatype
- belongs to class, not object
- doesn't need an object to initiate
#### Static Function
- _this_ keyword cannot be used
- only static members can only be used
```
    data_type class_name :: field name = value // " :: " -> scope resolution operator

    // in main(), same syntacs is used to print it.
```

### 4 Pillars of OOPS - Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism & Abstraction
#### Encapsulation
- wrapping up data member & function
- **Definition**: The process of grouping data members and corresponding methods into a single unit is known as Encapsulation.
- **Fully Encapsulated Class**: All data members are private  
- Advantage: a) Information hiding to increase security  
             b) if we want, we can make the class _read only_  
             c) code reusability
             d) unit testing
- Implementation:
```
    class Student{
        private:
            int roll;
            int section;
        public:
            int getRoll(){
                return this->roll;
            }
    };
```
#### Inheritance
-  Inheritance is the process of inheriting the properties and behavior of an existing class into a new class. When we inherit the class, we can reuse the existing class’s methods and fields into a new class. Inheritance can also be defined as the Is-A relationship, which is also known as the parent-child relationship.
#### Why do we need to use Inheritance?
-  The main advantage of inheritance is code reusability. We can reuse the code when we inherit the existing class’s methods and fields into a new class.
-  The runtime polymorphism (method overriding) can be achieved by inheritance only.

#### Important terminologies of Inheritance:
- **Sub-Class**: The class that inherits properties fromanother class is called Subclass or Derived Class.
- **Super-Class**: The class whose properties are inheritedby subclass is called Base Class or Superclass.
  
- Implementation:
```
    class parent_class{
        // body of the parent class
    };
    class child_class: access_modifier parent_class{
        // body of the child class
    };
```
#### Access Modifiers and Inheritance:
| Super-class Access Modifer | Mode of Inheritance | Resulting Access Modifier in Sub-class |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Public | Public | Public |
| Public | Protected | Protected |
| Public | Private | Private |
| Protected | Public | Protected |
| Protected | Protected | Protected |
| Protected | Private | Private |
| Private | Any | Not Accessible |
- Private data memebers of any class cannot be inherited
- **Protected Inheritance:** This is similar to Private inheritance, it cannot be accessed outside the class, but it can be accessed by that class itself, and by its child/derived class.
#### Types of Inheritance
- **Single Inheritance**
    - In single inheritance, one class can extend the functionality of another class. In single inheritance, there is only one parent class and one child class.
```
    class parent_class{
        // body of parent_class
    };
    class child_class: access_modifier parent_class{
        // body of child_class
    };
```
- **Multi-level Inheritance**
    - When a class inherits from a derived class, and the derived class becomes the base class of the new class, it is called multilevel inheritance. In multilevel inheritance, there is more than one level.
```
   class parent_class{
        // body of parent_class
    };
    class child_class: access_modifier parent_class{
        // body of child_class
    };
    class child_of_child_class: access_modifier child_class{
        // body of child_of_child_class
    };
```
- **Multiple Inheritance**
    - In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit more than one class. This means that in this type of inheritance, a single child class can have multiple parent classes.
```
    class parent_class_1{
        // body of parent_class_1
    };
    class parent_class_2{
        // body of parent_class_2
    };
    class child_class: access_modifier parent_class_1, access_modifier parent_class_2{
        // body of child_class
    };
```
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**
    - In hierarchical inheritance, one class serves as a base class for more than one derived class.
```
    class parent_class{
        // body of parent_class
    };
    class child_class_1: access_modifier parent_class{
        // body of child_class_1
    };
    class child_class_2: access_modifier parent_class{
        // body of child_class_2
    };
```
- **Hybrid Inheritance**
    - Hybrid inheritance is a combination of more than one type of inheritance. For example, A child and parent class relationship that follows multiple and hierarchical inheritances can be called hybrid inheritance.
```
    class parent_class_1{
        // body of parent_class_1
    };
    class parent_class_2{
        // body of parent_class_2
    };
    class child_class_1: access_modifier parent_class_1, access_modifier parent_class_2{
        // body of child_class_1 // multiple
    };
    class child_class_2: access_modifier parent_class_1{
        // body of child_class_2 // hierarchical
    };
```

- **Inheritance Ambiguity**
    - There may be a possibility that a class may inherit member functions with the same name from two or more base classes, and the derived class may not have functions with the same name as those of its base classes. If the derived class object needs to access one of the same-named member functions of the base classes, it results in ambiguity as it is not clear to the compiler which base class's member functio should be invoked.
```
    class A{
        public:
        void abc(){
            cout << "Class A" << endl;
        }
    };
    class B{
        public:
        void abc(){
            cout << "Class B" << endl;
        }
    };
    class C: public A, public B{
        public:
        void abc(){
            cout << "Class C" << endl;
        }
    };
    
    int main(){
        C obj;
        obj.abc();
    }
```
   - This ambiguity can be resolved by using the **scope resolution operator** by specifying the class in which the member function lies.
```
    class A{
        public:
        void abc(){
            cout << "Class A" << endl;
        }
    };
    class b{
        public:
        void abc(){
            cout << "Class B" << endl;
        }
    };
    class C: public A, public B{
        public:
        void abc(){
            cout << "Class C" << endl;
        }
    };
    
    int main(){
        C obj;
        obj.A :: abc();
    }
```
#### Polymorphism
: allows to perform a single action in different ways. (Greek _poly_: many, _morphs_: forms :: many forms)
#### Types of Polymorphism
- #### Compile Time Polymorphism
    - also known as static polymorphism. This type of polymorphism can be achieved through function overloading or operator overloading.
    - a) **Function Overloading**: When there are multiple functions in a class with the same name with different parameters, these functions are overloaded.
    - Advantage: It increases the readability of the code.  
        i) By using different number of arguments
        ii) By using different types of arguments
        **Default argument**: A default argument is a value providedin a function declaration automatically assigned by the compiler if the function’s caller doesn’t provide a value for the argument with a default value. However, if arguments are passed while calling the function, the default arguments are ignored.
    - b) **Operator Overloading**: 
         i) can be used only for user-defined operators (objects, structures), cannot be used for in-built operators
         ii) operators "=" and "&" are already overloaded, so we can avoid overloading them
         iii) precedence and associativity of operators remain intact.  
         **List of operators that can be overloaded in C++**:  
         
         | + | - | * | / | % | ^ | 
         | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |  
         | & | \| | ~ | ! | , | = |  
         | < | > | <= | >= | ++ | -- |  
         | << | >> | == | != | && | \|\| |
         | += | -= | \*= | /= | %= | ^= |
         | &= | \|= | <<= | >>= | [ ] | ( ) |
         | -> | ->\* | new | new[ ] | delete | delete[ ] |  
         
        **List of operators that cannot be overloaded in C++**:  
        
         | :: | .* | . | ? : |  
         | -- | -- | -- | -- |
- #### Run Time Polymorphism
    - also known as dynamic polymorphism. Method of overriding is a way to implement runtime polymorphism.  
    - **Method overriding**: It allows to redefine a function of the parent class in the child class according to the requirement.  
    - **Rules for Method Overriding**:
    - The method of the parent class and child class must have the same name and same parameters.  
    - It is possible through inheritance only.  
#### Abstraction
: Data abstraction refers to providing only necessary information to outside, hiding the background details or implementation.
- **Abstraction using Header files**:
    - Using header files
- **Abstraction using Classes**:
    - Using access modifiers
- **Advantages of Abstraction**
    - Only you can change the data members, no other else can, hence increasing security.
    - Increases reusability.
    - Helps to avoid duplication of your code.  
 
## Difference betweeen Encapsulation and Abstraction:
- _Encapsulation_ : **Information hiding**
- _Abstraction_ : **Implementation hiding**
